        const contentMap2 = {
            'steps1': ' To perform a depth jump to hurdle hop, start by standing on a box or an elevated surface. Step off the box, landing softly on the balls of your feet with your knees slightly bent. Immediately upon landing, explosively jump forward over a hurdle or any obstacle in front of you. Swing your arms for momentum and land softly on the other side of the hurdle. As soon as you land, go into another depth jump by stepping off the ground and repeating the process. Focus on your form, ensuring your knees are aligned with your feet to prevent injury. Perform this exercise in a controlled manner, emphasizing explosive power and quick movements.',
'steps2': 'Begin by standing with your feet hip-width apart. Take a step forward with your right foot, lowering your body until your right thigh is parallel to the ground, forming a 90-degree angle at your knee. Your left knee should hover just above the floor. Push off your right foot to return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side, stepping forward with your left foot. Alternate legs and perform the lunges in a fluid, controlled motion. Engage your core muscles for stability and make sure your front knee does not extend beyond your toes to avoid strain.',
'steps3': 'Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and assume a boxing stance. Hold your fists up near your face, elbows bent. Start punching the air with alternating arms, incorporating jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts. Pivot your feet and hips as you punch, engaging your core muscles for power. Move around as you punch, simulating footwork and incorporating defensive moves like ducking and weaving. Keep your movements controlled and focus on your breathing. Shadow boxing can be done for a set duration or combined with other exercises in a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout.',
'steps4': 'Mount your bicycle and start pedaling at a comfortable pace. Adjust the gears based on the terrain and your fitness level. Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and hands on the handlebars. Engage your core muscles for stability. To increase intensity, pedal faster or tackle inclines. Focus on smooth, consistent pedaling and maintain a steady breathing rhythm. Be aware of your surroundings, follow traffic rules, and wear appropriate safety gear, including a helmet. Riding outdoor bicycles offers the flexibility to explore different routes, making your workout both enjoyable and challenging.',
'steps5': 'Start by standing upright with your shoulders relaxed and your arms hanging naturally by your sides. Take a step forward with your right foot, rolling from heel to toe. Follow with your left foot, continuing the natural rolling motion. Swing your arms gently in rhythm with your steps. Maintain a brisk but comfortable pace, keeping your back straight and chin parallel to the ground. Land softly on your feet and breathe deeply and rhythmically. You can walk outdoors in parks, trails, or neighborhoods, enjoying the fresh air and changing scenery. Wear comfortable walking shoes and, if necessary, use a pedometer to track your steps and progress.',
'steps6': 'Brisk walking follows the same basic technique as regular walking but at a faster pace. Start with a warm-up by walking at a moderate pace for a few minutes. Then, increase your speed, swinging your arms vigorously and taking larger steps. Focus on covering more ground with each step while maintaining a natural and comfortable stride. Keep your posture upright and engage your core muscles. Aim to walk at a pace that elevates your heart rate and makes you slightly breathless but still able to hold a conversation. Brisk walking can be done on sidewalks, tracks, or even on a treadmill indoors.',
'steps7': 'Find a flat, open space for sprinting. Begin by warming up with light jogging or dynamic stretches. When youre ready, start sprinting as fast as you can, driving your knees up and pumping your arms vigorously. Focus on short, powerful strides and maintain a strong posture. Sprint for a specific distance or time, aiming for maximum speed. After each sprint, allow yourself to recover by walking or jogging slowly. Focus on your form, ensuring your feet land beneath your body to optimize speed and reduce the risk of injury. Sprinting can be incorporated into interval training routines for an added cardiovascular challenge.',
'steps8': 'Step onto the wave machine, gripping the handles lightly for balance. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. The machine will start to move in a wave-like motion. Begin walking, allowing your feet to follow the natural motion of the machine. Engage your core muscles to maintain balance and stability. Focus on a smooth, controlled movement, keeping your strides consistent. You can adjust the speed and intensity of the wave machine based on your fitness level and goals. Be mindful of your posture and avoid leaning on the handles excessively. Walking on the wave machine provides a unique challenge to your balance and coordination while offering a low-impact cardiovascular workout.',
'steps9': ' Start by adjusting the treadmill to a slight incline. Step onto the treadmill and begin walking or jogging at a comfortable pace. As you become accustomed to the incline, gradually increase the gradient to intensify the workout. Focus on using your glutes and leg muscles to push against the incline. Maintain a natural arm swing and proper posture, keeping your back straight and shoulders relaxed. Monitor your heart rate and breathing, ensuring youre working within your target intensity zone. To cool down, gradually reduce the incline and pace before stepping off the treadmill. Incline treadmill workouts are effective for building lower body strength and endurance while burning calories.',
'steps10': 'Step onto the elliptical machine and grasp the handles with a firm but comfortable grip. Stand tall with your feet flat on the pedals. Start pedaling in a smooth, continuous motion, pushing and pulling the handles in sync with your leg movements. Engage your core muscles to maintain stability and support your back. The elliptical allows for forward and backward motion, so vary your stride pattern to target different leg muscles. Adjust the resistance level and incline to increase intensity. Focus on proper form, ensuring your knees are aligned with your feet, and avoid locking your joints. Elliptical workouts can be tailored to your fitness goals, whether its high-intensity intervals or steady-state cardio, providing a full-body, low-impact workout experience.',
